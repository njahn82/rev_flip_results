The on-line order form can be used for all orders, which will then be directed to the appropriate place.
At the same time, we are changing the price structure and access to our journals. The journals were started by a group of enthusiasts who dedicated their time freely. For long-term stability of the journals, this group of enthusiasts is gradually being replaced by permanent paid staff. The income generated by subscriptions in the presence of a free on-line version was not sufficient to cover this new structure and we have been forced to start to charge for on-line access. However all our publications will continue to be stored in the arXiv and therefore freely available to individuals. However access to our main sites will only be allowed from an IP address in a subscribing institution. All readers are encouraged to persuade their libraries to take out electronic subscription. Electronic access will be open and free for all publications after a period of two years.
We are determined to keep our prices as low as we can manage and are basing the price structure on 10c per page for electronic access and 15c per page for printed copy with electronic access. Prices are being based on an estimate of page length and since both journals are growing fast, the actual per page costs are likely to be considerable lower. These prices make our journals some of the lowest priced available.

A final component of the restructuring is that we are no longer delaying print publication until the end of the year. Thus in 2006 volume 10 of GT will be published in 500 page (approx) parts throughout the year. This means that the 2006 subscription year will cover both 2005 (which will be published as usual in one chunk at the beginning of 2006) and 2006 itself. In order to spread the double cost, we suggest that libraries purchase their 2005 print subscription now and their 2006 print subscription in say March 2006, when the first part of Volume 10 is ready to distribute.

The income generated by subscriptions in the presence of a free on-line version was not sufficient to cover this new structure and we have been forced to start to charge for on-line access.

Electronic access will be open and free for all publications after a period of two years.

A final component of the restructuring is that we are no longer delaying print publication until the end of the year. Thus in 2006 volume 10 of GT will be published in 500 page (approx) parts throughout the year. This means that the 2006 subscription year will cover both 2005 (which will be published as usual in one chunk at the beginning of 2006) and 2006 itself. In order to spread the double cost, we suggest that libraries purchase their 2005 print subscription now and their 2006 print subscription in say March 2006, when the first part of Volume 10 is ready to distribute.
